The iterative nature of KSP means that it will still be slightly off, but I regularly land around 1.5m/s with this throttle function:

function getThrottleForHeightVf
{
	parameter vel, acc, g, h, velFinal.
	// vel is the current vertical velocity
	// acc is the current available vertical acceleration based on current pitch
	// g is the local acceleration due to gravity
	// h is the height, it is very important that this is calibrated to
	// velFinal is the desired final velocity.
	// account for the offset of the bottom of the vessel from the CoM
	// negative values of tgtacc mean accelerating towards the body (down),
	// positive values mean accelerating away from the body (up).
	local tgtacc is 0.
	local thrtl is 0.
	set tgtacc to -1 * (velFinal ^ 2 - vel ^ 2) / 2 / max(h, 0.01).
	set thrtl to (tgtacc + g) / max(acc, 0.01).
	return thrtl.
}
